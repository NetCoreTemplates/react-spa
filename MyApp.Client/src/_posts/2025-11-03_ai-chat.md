We're excited to introduce **AI Chat** — a refreshingly simple solution for integrating AI into your applications by 
unlocking the full value of the OpenAI Chat API. Unlike most other OpenAI SDKs and Frameworks, all of AI Chat's features
are centered around arguably the most important API in our time - OpenAI's simple [Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)
i.e. the primary API used to access Large Language Models (LLMs).

We've had several attempts at adding a valuable layer of functionality for harnessing AI into our Apps, including:
- [GptAgentFeature](https://servicestack.net/posts/chat-gpt-agents) - Use Semantic Kernel to implement our own Chain-of-Thought functionality to develop Autonomous agents
- [TypeScript TypeChat](https://servicestack.net/posts/typescript-typechat-examples) - Use Semantic Kernel to implement all of TypeScript's TypeChat examples in .NET
- [ServiceStack.AI](https://servicestack.net/posts/servicestack-ai) - TypeChat providers and unified Abstractions over AWS, Azure and Google Cloud AI Providers

The problem being that we wouldn't consider any of these solutions to be relevant today, any "smarts" or opinionated
logic added look to become irrelevant as AI models get more capable and intelligent. 

## The Problem with Complex Abstractions

Over the years, we've seen AI integration libraries grow in complexity. Take 
[Microsoft Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) - a sprawling codebase 
that maintains its own opinionated abstractions that aren't serializable and has endured several breaking changes 
over the years. After investing development effort in catching up with their breaking changes we're now told to
[Migrate to Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/migration-guide/from-semantic-kernel/).

The fundamental issue? These complex abstractions didn't prove to be reusable. Microsoft's own next competing solution
[Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) - doesn't even use Semantic Kernel Abstractions. 
Instead, it maintains its own non-serializable complex abstractions, repeating the same architectural issues.

This pattern of building heavyweight, non-portable abstractions creates vendor lock-in, adds friction, hinders reuse,
and limits how and where it can be used. After getting very little value from Semantic Kernel, we don't plan for any 
rewrites to follow adoption of their next over-engineered framework. 

## Back to OpenAI Chat

The only AI Abstraction we feel confident that has any longevity in this space, that wont be subject to breaking changes 
and rewrites is the underlying OpenAI Chat Completion API itself. 

The API with the most utility, with all the hard work of having AI Providers adopt this common API already 
done for us, we just have to facilitate calling it.

Something so simple that it can be easily called from a shell script:

```bash
RESPONSE=$(curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Capital of France?"}]
  }')

echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -r '.choices[0].message.content'
```

Shouldn't require complex libraries over several NuGet packages to make use of. 

The simplest and obvious solution is design around the core `ChatCompletion` DTO itself - a simple, serializable, 
implementation-free data structure that maps directly to the OpenAI Chat API request body maintained in 
[ChatCompletion.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.AI.Chat/ChatCompletion.cs)
with all its functionality encapsulated (no third-party dependencies) within the new **ServiceStack.AI.Chat** NuGet package.

Using DTOs gives us all the natural [advantages of message-based APIs](https://docs.servicestack.net/advantages-of-message-based-web-services) 
whose clean POCO models helps us [fight against complexity](https://docs.servicestack.net/service-complexity-and-dto-roles).

### Why This Matters

Because `ChatCompletion` is a plain serializable DTO, you can:

- **Store it in a database** - Save conversation history, audit AI requests, or implement retry logic
- **Use it in client workflows** - Pass the same DTO between frontend and backend without transformations
- **Send it through message queues** - Build asynchronous AI processing pipelines with RabbitMQ and others
- **Debug easily** - Inspect the exact JSON being sent to OpenAI
- **Test easily** - Mock AI responses with simple DTOs or JSON payloads
- **Use it outside the library** - The DTO works independently of any specific client implementation

More importantly, because it's a **Request DTO**, we unlock a wealth of ServiceStack features for free, 
since most of ServiceStack's functionality is designed around Request DTOs — which we'll explore later.

## Install

AI Chat can be added to any .NET 8+ project by installing the **ServiceStack.AI.Chat** NuGet package and configuration with:

:::sh
x mix chat
:::

Which drops this simple [Modular Startup](https://docs.servicestack.net/modular-startup) that adds the `ChatFeature`
and registers a link to its UI on the [Metadata Page](https://docs.servicestack.net/metadata-page) if you want it:

```csharp
public class ConfigureAiChat : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices(services => {
            services.AddPlugin(new ChatFeature());
             
            services.ConfigurePlugin<MetadataFeature>(feature => {
                feature.AddPluginLink("/chat", "AI Chat");
            });
       });
}
```

## Simple, Not Simplistic

How simple is it to use? It's just as you'd expect, your App logic need only bind to a simple `IChatClient` interface
that accepts a Typed `ChatCompletion` Request DTO and returns a Typed `ChatResponse` DTO:

```csharp
public interface IChatClient
{
    Task<ChatResponse> ChatAsync(
        ChatCompletion request, CancellationToken token=default);
}
```

An impl-free easily substitutable interface for calling any OpenAI-compatible Chat API, using clean
Typed `ChatCompletion` and `ChatResponse` DTOs.

Unfortunately since the API needs to be typed and .NET Serializers don't have support for de/serializing union types
yet, the DTO adopts OpenAI's more verbose and flexible multi-part Content Type which looks like: 

```csharp
IChatClient client = CreateClient();

var request = new ChatCompletion
{
    Model = "gpt-5",
    Messages = [
        new() {
            Role = "user",
            Content = [
                new AiTextContent {
                    Type = "text", Text = "Capital of France?"
                }
            ],
        }
    ]
};

var response = await client.ChatAsync(request);
```

To improve the UX we've added a [Message.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.AI.Chat/Message.cs) helper
which encapsulates the boilerplate of sending **Text**, **Image**, **Audio** and **Files** into more 
succinct and readable code where you'd typically only need to write: 

```csharp
var request = new ChatCompletion
{
    Model = "gpt-5",
    Messages = [
        Message.SystemPrompt("You are a helpful assistant"),
        Message.Text("Capital of France?"),
    ]
};
var response = await client.ChatAsync(request);
string? answer = response.GetAnswer(); 
```

### Same ChatCompletion DTO, Used Everywhere

That's all that's required for your internal App Logic to access your App's configured AI Models. However, as 
AI Chat also makes its own OpenAI Compatible API available, your external .NET Clients can use the 
**same exact DTO** to get the **same Response** by calling your API with a 
[C# Service Client](https://docs.servicestack.net/csharp-client):

```csharp
var client = new JsonApiClient(BaseUrl) {
    BearerToken = apiKey
};
var response = await client.SendAsync(request);
```

### Support for Text, Images, Audio & Files

For Multi-modal LLMs which support it, you can also send Images, Audio & File attachments with your AI Request
using **URLs**, e.g:

```csharp
var image = new ChatCompletion
{
    Model = "qwen2.5vl",
    Messages = [
        Message.Image(imageUrl:"https://example.org/image.webp",
            text:"Describe the key features of the input image"),
    ]
}

var audio = new ChatCompletion
{
    Model = "gpt-4o-audio-preview",
    Messages = [
        Message.Audio(data:"https://example.org/speaker.mp3",
            text:"Please transcribe and summarize this audio file"),
    ]
};

var file = new ChatCompletion
{
    Model = "gemini-flash-latest",
    Messages = [
        Message.File(
            fileData:"https://example.org/order.pdf",
            text:"Please summarize this document"),
    ]
};
```

#### Relative File Path

If a [VirtualFiles Provider](https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system) was configured, you can specify a relative path instead:

```csharp
var image = new ChatCompletion
{
    Model = "qwen2.5vl",
    Messages = [
        Message.Image(imageUrl:"/path/to/image.webp",
            text:"Describe the key features of the input image"),
    ]
};
```

#### Manual Download & Embedding

Alternatively you can embed and send the raw Base64 Data or Data URI yourself:

```csharp
var bytes = await "https://example.org/image.webp".GetBytesFromUrlAsync();
var dataUri = $"data:image/webp;base64,{Convert.ToBase64String(bytes)}";
var image = new ChatCompletion
{
    Model = "qwen2.5vl",
    Messages = [
        Message.Image(imageUrl:dataUri,
            text:"Describe the key features of the input image"),
    ]
};
```

Although sending references to external resources allows keeping AI Requests payloads small, making them 
easier to store in Databases, send in MQs and client workflows, etc.

This illustrates some of the "value-added" features of AI Chat where it will automatically download any URL Resources
and embed it as Base64 Data in the `ChatCompletion` Request DTO.

### Configure Downloads

Relative paths can be enabled by configuring a `VirtualFiles` Provider to refer to a safe path that you want to allow 
access to.

Whilst URLs are downloaded by default, but its behavior can be customized with `ValidateUrl` or replaced entirely with 
`DownloadUrlAsBase64Async`: 

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new ChatFeature {
    // Enable Relative Path Downloads
    VirtualFiles = new FileSystemVirtualFiles(assetDir),

    // Validate URLs before download
    ValidateUrl = url => {
        if (!IsAllowedUrl(url))
            throw HttpError.Forbidden("URL not allowed");
    },
    
    // Use Custom URL Downloader
    // DownloadUrlAsBase64Async = async (provider, url) => {
    //     var (base64, mimeType) = await MyDownloadAsync(url);
    //     return (base64, mimeType);
    // },
});
```

## Configure AI Providers

By default AI Chat is configured with a list of providers in its `llms.json`
which is pre-configured with the best models from the leading LLM providers.

The easiest way to use a custom `llms.json` is to add a local modified copy of
[llms.json](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.AI.Chat/chat/llms.json) 
to your App's `/wwwroot/chat` folder:

```files
/wwwroot
  /chat
    llms.json
```

If you just need to change which providers are enabled you can specify them in `EnableProviders`:

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new ChatFeature {
    // Specify which providers you want to enable
    EnableProviders =
    [
        "openrouter_free",
        "groq",
        "google_free",
        "codestral",
        "ollama",
        "openrouter",
        "google",
        "anthropic",
        "openai",
        "grok",
        "qwen",
        "z.ai",
        "mistral",
    ],

    // Use custom llms.json configuration
    ConfigJson = vfs.GetFile("App_Data/llms.json").ReadAllText(),
});
```

Alternatively you can use `ConfigJson` to load a custom JSON provider configuration from a different source, which 
you'll want to use if you prefer to keep your provider configuration and API Keys all in `llms.json`.

### llms.json - OpenAI Provider Configuration

[llms.json](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.AI.Chat/chat/llms.json)
contains a list of OpenAI Compatible Providers you want to make available along with a user-defined **model alias**
you want to use for model routing along with the provider-specific model name it maps to when the model is used 
with that provider, e.g:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "enabled": false,
      "type": "OpenAiProvider",
      "base_url": "https://openrouter.ai/api",
      "api_key": "$OPENROUTER_API_KEY",
      "models": {
        "grok-4": "x-ai/grok-4",
        "glm-4.5-air": "z-ai/glm-4.5-air",
        "kimi-k2": "moonshotai/kimi-k2",
        "deepseek-v3.1:671b": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
        "llama4:400b": "meta-llama/llama-4-maverick"
      }
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "enabled": false,
      "type": "OpenAiProvider",
      "base_url": "https://api.anthropic.com",
      "api_key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY",
      "models": {
        "claude-sonnet-4-0": "claude-sonnet-4-0"
      }
    },
    "ollama": {
      "enabled": false,
      "type": "OllamaProvider",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
      "models": {},
      "all_models": true
    },
    "google": {
      "enabled": false,
      "type": "GoogleProvider",
      "api_key": "$GOOGLE_API_KEY",
      "models": {
        "gemini-flash-latest": "gemini-flash-latest",
        "gemini-flash-lite-latest": "gemini-flash-lite-latest",
        "gemini-2.5-pro": "gemini-2.5-pro",
        "gemini-2.5-flash": "gemini-2.5-flash",
        "gemini-2.5-flash-lite": "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
      },
      "safety_settings": [
        {
          "category": "HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT",
          "threshold": "BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH"
        }
      ],
      "thinking_config": {
        "thinkingBudget": 1024,
        "includeThoughts": true
      }
    },
    //...
  }
}
```

The only non-OpenAI Chat Provider AI Chat supports is `GoogleProvider`, where an exception was made to add explicit 
support for Gemini's Models given its low cost and generous free quotas.

### Provider API Keys

API Keys can be either be specified within the `llms.json` itself, alternatively API Keys starting with `$` like 
`$GOOGLE_API_KEY` will first try to resolve it from `Variables` before falling back to checking Environment Variables.

```csharp
services.AddPlugin(new ChatFeature {
    EnableProviders =
    [
        "openrouter",
        "anthropic",
        "google",
    ],
    Variables =
    {
        ["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"] = secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
        ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
        ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = secrets.GOOGLE_API_KEY,
    }
});
```

### Model Routing and Failover

Providers are invoked in the order they're defined in `llms.json` that supports the requested model. 
If a provider fails, it tries the next available provider.

This enables scenarios like:
- Routing different request types to different providers
- Optimize by Cost, Performance, Reliability, or Privacy
- A/B testing different models
- Added resilience with fallback when a provider is unavailable

The model aliases don't need to identify a model directly, e.g. you could use your own artificial names for use-cases 
you need like `image-captioner`, `audio-transcriber`, `pdf-extractor` then map them to different models different providers 
should use to achieve the desired task.

#### Use Model Routing with Fallback

To make use of the model routing and fallback you would call `ChatAsync` on `IChatClient` directly:

```csharp
class MyService(IChatClient client)
{
    public async Task<object> Any(DefaultChat request)
    {
        return await client.ChatAsync(new ChatCompletion {
            Model = "glm-4.6",
            Messages = [
                Message.Text(request.UserPrompt)
            ],
        });
    }
}
```

#### Use Specific Provider

Alternatively to use a specific provider, you can use `IChatClients` dependency `GetClient(providerId)` method 
to resolve the provider then calling `ChatAsync` will only use that provider:

```csharp
class MyService(IChatClients clients)
{
    public async Task<object> Any(ProviderChat request)
    {
        var groq = clients.GetClient("groq");
        return await groq.ChatAsync(new ChatCompletion {
            Model = "kimi-k2",
            Messages = [
                Message.Text(request.UserPrompt)
            ],
        });
    }
}
```

## Persist AI Chat History

By default AI Chat is designed to be minimally invasive and doesn't require anything other than the API Keys
needed to access the AI Models it should use. 

If preferred you can choose to persist AI Chat History made through the external ChatCompletion API with the
`OnChatCompletionSuccessAsync` and `OnChatCompletionFailedAsync` callbacks which can be used to store successful
and failed requests in your preferred data store using the included 
[ChatCompletionLog](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack/src/ServiceStack.AI.Chat/ChatCompletionLog.cs)
or your own data model:

```csharp
public class ConfigureAiChat : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices(services => {
            services.AddPlugin(new ChatFeature
            {
                OnChatCompletionSuccessAsync = async (request, response, req) => {
                    using var db = await req.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>().OpenAsync();
                    await db.InsertAsync(req.ToChatCompletionLog(request, response));
                },
                OnChatCompletionFailedAsync = async (request, exception, req) => {
                    using var db = await req.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>().OpenAsync();
                    await db.InsertAsync(req.ToChatCompletionLog(request, exception));
                },
            });
       }).ConfigureAppHost(appHost => {
            using var db = appHost.Resolve<IDbConnectionFactory>().Open();
            db.CreateTableIfNotExists<ChatCompletionLog>();
       });
}
```

### Compatible with llms.py 

The other benefit of simple configuration and simple solutions, is that they're easy to implement. A perfect example
of this being that this is the 2nd implementation done using this configuration. The same configuration, UI, APIs
and functionality is also available in our [llms.py](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms) Python CLI and server gateway we've developed 
in order to have a dependency-free LLM Gateway solution needed in our ComfyUI Agents.  

:::sh
pip install llms-py
:::

This also means you can use and test your own custom `llms.json` configuration on the command-line or in shell 
automation scripts:

```sh
# Simple question
llms "Explain quantum computing"

# With specific model
llms -m gemini-2.5-pro "Write a Python function to sort a list"

# With system prompt
llms -s "You are a helpful coding assistant" "Reverse a string in Python?"

# With image (vision models)
llms --image image.jpg "What's in this image?"
llms --image https://example.com/photo.png "Describe this photo"

# Display full JSON Response
llms "Explain quantum computing" --raw

# Start the UI and an OpenAI compatible API on port 8000:
llms --serve 8000
```

Incidentally as [llms.py UI](https://servicestack.net/posts/llms-py-ui) and AI Chat utilize the same UI you can use its
**import/export** features to transfer your AI Chat History between them.

Checkout the [llms.py GitHub repo](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms) for even more features.
