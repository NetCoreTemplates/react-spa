JavaScript has progressed significantly in recent times where many of the tooling & language enhancements
that we used to rely on external tools for is now available in modern browsers alleviating the need for
complex tooling and npm dependencies that have historically plagued modern web development.

The good news is that the complex npm tooling that was previously considered mandatory in modern JavaScript App
development can be considered optional as we can now utilize modern browser features like
[async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function),
[JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules),
[dynamic imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import),
[import maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
and [modern language features](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) for a
sophisticated development workflow without the need for any npm build tools.

### Bringing Simplicity Back

The [razor](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor) template focuses on simplicity and eschews many aspects that has
complicated modern JavaScript development,
specifically:

- No npm node_modules or build tools
- No client side routing
- No heavy client state

Effectively abandoning the traditional SPA approach in lieu of a simpler [MPA](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/mpa-vs-spa/)
development model using Razor Pages for Server Rendered content with any interactive UIs progressively enhanced with JavaScript.

#### Freedom to use any JS library

Avoiding the SPA route ends up affording more flexibility on which JS libraries each page can use as without heavy bundled JS
blobs of all JS used in the entire App, it's free to only load the required JS each page needs to best implement its
required functionality, which can be any JS library, preferably utilizing ESM builds that can be referenced from a
[JavaScript Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), taking advantage of the module system
native to modern browsers able to efficiently download the declarative matrix of dependencies each script needs.

### Best libraries for progressive Multi Page Apps

It includes a collection of libraries we believe offers the best modern development experience in Progressive
MPA Web Apps, specifically:

#### [Tailwind CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
Tailwind enables a responsive, utility-first CSS framework for creating maintainable CSS at scale without the need for any CSS
preprocessors like Sass, which is configured to run from an npx script to avoid needing any node_module dependencies.

#### [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
Vue is a popular Progressive JavaScript Framework that makes it easy to create interactive Reactive Components whose
[Composition API](https://vuejs.org/api/composition-api-setup.html) offers a nice development model without requiring any
pre-processors like JSX.

Where creating a component is as simple as:

```jsx
type Props = { name:string }
export default ({ name }:Props) => (<b>Hello, {name}!</b>)
```
<div className="text-center text-2xl py-2">
    <Hello name="Vue 3" />
</div>

Or a simple reactive example:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export default () => {
    let [count, setCount] = useState(1)
    return <b onClick={() => setCount(count+=1)}>Counter {count}</b>
}
```

<div className="text-center text-2xl py-2 cursor-pointer select-none">
    <Counter />
</div>

### React Components in Markdown

Inside `.mdx` Markdown pages React Components can be embedded using MDX Syntax:

```tsx
<Hello name="Vue 3" />
<Counter />
```

```tsx
import { Button as PrimaryButton } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dialog"

export default () => {
  return (<Dialog>
      <DialogTrigger asChild>
        <PrimaryButton>Open Modal</PrimaryButton>
      </DialogTrigger>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Greetings</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription className="p-4 text-xl">
            Hello @servicestack/vue!
          </DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>)
}
```

```tsx
<Plugin />
```

<div className="text-center">
    <Plugin id="plugin" className="text-2xl py-4" />
</div>


## API Development

For better IDE intelli-sense during development, you can save your server's annotated Typed DTOs to disk with:

:::sh
npm run dtos
:::

That can be referenced instead to unlock your IDE's static analysis type-checking and intelli-sense benefits during development:

```js
import { Hello } from '@/dtos'
client.api(new Hello({ name }))
```

You'll typically use all these libraries in your **API-enabled** components as seen in the
[HelloApi.tsx](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/react-spa/blob/main/MyApp.Client/src/_posts/components/HelloApi.tsx)
component which calls the [Hello](https://react-spa.web-templates.io/ui/Hello) API on each key press:

```tsx
import { ChangeEvent, useState, useEffect } from "react"
import { JsonServiceClient } from "@servicestack/client"
import { TextInput } from "@/components/Form"
import { Hello } from "@/dtos"

type Props = { value: string }
export default ({ value }:Props) => {
    const [name, setName] = useState(value)
    const [result, setResult] = useState('')
    
    const client = new JsonServiceClient()
    useEffect(() => {
        (async () => {
            let api = await client.api(new Hello({ name }))
            if (api.response) {
                setResult(api.response.result)
            }
        })()
    }, [name])

    return (<div className="my-8 max-w-fit mx-auto">
      <TextInput value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <b className="my-2 block text-center text-lg">{result}</b>
    </div>)
}
```

```tsx
<HelloApi value="React" />
```

<HelloApi value="React" />
