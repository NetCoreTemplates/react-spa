## New Blogging features in Razor SSG

[Razor SSG](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io) is our Free Project Template for creating fast, statically generated Websites and Blogs with
Markdown & C# Razor Pages. A benefit of using Razor SSG to maintain this 
[servicestack.net(github)](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack.net) website is that any improvements added
to our website end up being rolled into the Razor SSG Project Template for everyone else to enjoy.

This latest release brings a number of features and enhancements to improve Razor SSG usage as a Blogging Platform -
a primary use-case we're focused on as we pen our [22nd Blog Post for the year](https://servicestack.net/posts/year/2023) with improvements
in both discoverability and capability of blog posts:

### RSS Feed

Razor SSG websites now generates a valid RSS Feed for its blog to support their readers who'd prefer to read blog posts
and notify them as they're published with their favorite RSS reader:

<div class="not-prose my-8">
   <a href="https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/feed.xml">
      <div class="block flex justify-center shadow hover:shadow-lg rounded overflow-hidden">
         <img class="max-w-3xl py-8" src="https://servicestack.net/img/posts/razor-ssg/valid-rss.png">
      </div>
   </a>
    <div class="mt-4 flex justify-center">
        <a class="text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800" href="https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/feed.xml">https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/feed.xml</a>
        <a class="ml-4 text-indigo-600 hover:text-indigo-800" href="https://servicestack.net/feed.xml">https://servicestack.net/feed.xml</a>
    </div>
</div>

### Meta Headers support for Twitter cards and SEO

Blog Posts and Pages now include additional `<meta>` HTML Headers to enable support for 
[Twitter Cards](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/overview/abouts-cards) in both
Twitter and Meta's new [threads.net](https://threads.net), e.g:

<div class="not-prose my-8 flex justify-center">
   <a class="block max-w-2xl" href="https://www.threads.net/@servicestack/post/CvIFobPBs5h">
      <div class="block flex justify-center shadow hover:shadow-lg rounded overflow-hidden">
         <img class="py-8" src="https://servicestack.net/img/posts/razor-ssg/twitter-cards.png">
      </div>
   </a>
</div>

### Improved Discoverability

To improve discoverability and increase site engagement, bottom of blog posts now include links to other posts by
the same Blog Author, including links to connect to their preferred social networks and contact preferences:

![](https://servicestack.net/img/posts/razor-ssg/other-author-posts.png)

### Posts can include Vue Components

Blog Posts can now embed any global Vue Components directly in its Markdown, e.g: 

```html
<getting-started template="razor-ssg"></getting-started>
```

#### [/mjs/components/GettingStarted.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/mjs/components/GettingStarted.mjs)

<div class="not-prose my-20 flex justify-center">
    <getting-started template="razor-ssg"></getting-started>
</div>

#### Individual Blog Post dependencies

Just like Pages and Docs they can also include specific JavaScript **.mjs** or **.css** in the `/wwwroot/posts` folder
which will only be loaded for that post:

<file-layout :files="{
    wwwroot: { 
        posts: { _: ['<slug>.mjs','<slug>.css'] },
    }
}"></file-layout>

Now posts that need it can dynamically load large libraries like [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) and use it 
inside a custom Vue component by creating a custom `/posts/<slug>.mjs` that exports what components and features
your blog post needs, e.g:

#### [/posts/new-blog-features.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/posts/new-blog-features.mjs)

```js
import ChartJs from './components/ChartJs.mjs'

export default {
    components: { ChartJs }
}
```

In this case it enables support for [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) by including a custom Vue component that makes it
easy to create charts from Vue Components embedded in markdown:

#### [/posts/components/ChartJs.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/posts/components/ChartJs.mjs)

```js
import { ref, onMounted } from "vue"
import { addScript } from "@servicestack/client"

let loadJs = addScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js/dist/chart.umd.min.js')

export default {
    template:`<div><canvas ref="chart"></canvas></div>`,
    props:['type','data','options'],
    setup(props) {
        const chart = ref()
        onMounted(async () => {
            await loadJs

            const options = props.options || {
                responsive: true,
                legend: {
                    position: "top"
                }
            }
            new Chart(chart.value, {
                type: props.type || "bar",
                data: props.data,
                options,
            })

        })
        return { chart }
    }
}
```

Which allows this post to embed Chart.js charts using the above custom `<chart-js>` Vue component and a JS Object literal, e.g: 

```html
<chart-js :data="{
    labels: [
        //...
    ],
    datasets: [
        //...
    ]
}"></chart-js>
```

Which the [Bulk Insert Performance](https://servicestack.net/posts/bulk-insert-performance) Blog Post uses extensively to embeds its
Chart.js Bar charts:

<chart-js :data="{
    labels: [
        '10,000 Rows',
        '100,000 Rows'
    ],
    datasets: [
        {
            label: 'SQLite Memory',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(201, 203, 207, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(201, 203, 207)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [17.066, 166.747]
        },
        {
            label: 'SQLite Disk',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [20.224, 199.697]
        },
        {
            label: 'PostgreSQL',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(153, 102, 255)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [14.389, 115.645]
        },
        {
            label: 'MySQL',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(54, 162, 235)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [64.389, 310.966]
        },
        {
            label: 'MySqlConnector',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(255, 159, 64)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [64.427, 308.574]
        },
        {
            label: 'SQL Server',
            backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)',
            borderColor: 'rgb(255, 99, 132)',
            borderWidth: 1,
            data: [89.821, 835.181]
        }
    ]
}"></chart-js>

### New Markdown Containers

[Custom Containers](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig.Tests/Specs/CustomContainerSpecs.md) 
are a popular method for implementing Markdown Extensions for enabling rich, wrist-friendly consistent 
content in your Markdown documents.

Most of [VitePress Markdown Containers](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown#custom-containers)
are also available in Razor SSG websites for enabling rich, wrist-friendly consistent markup in your Markdown pages, e.g:

```md
:::info
This is an info box.
:::

:::tip
This is a tip.
:::

:::warning
This is a warning.
:::

:::danger
This is a dangerous warning.
:::

:::copy
Copy Me!
:::
```

:::info{.test}
This is an info box.
:::

:::tip
This is a tip.
:::

:::warning
This is a warning.
:::

:::danger
This is a dangerous warning.
:::

:::copy
Copy Me!
:::

:::sh
dotnet tool install --global x
:::

See Razor Press's [Markdown Containers docs](https://razor-press.web-templates.io/containers) for the complete list of available containers and examples on how to 
implement your own [Custom Markdown containers](https://razor-press.web-templates.io/containers#implementing-block-containers).

### Support for Includes

Markdown fragments can be added to `_pages/_include` - a special folder rendered with
[Pages/Includes.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Includes.cshtml) using
an [Empty Layout](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Shared/_LayoutEmpty.cshtml)
which can be included in other Markdown and Razor Pages or fetched on demand with Ajax.

Markdown Fragments can be then included inside other markdown documents with the `::include` inline container, e.g:

:::pre
::include vue/formatters.md::
:::

#### Element

<include src="formatters.md" />

<TestComponent />

Where it will be replaced with the HTML rendered markdown contents of fragments maintained in `_pages/_include`.

### Include Markdown in Razor Pages

Markdown Fragments can also be included in Razor Pages using the custom `MarkdownTagHelper.cs` `<markdown/>` tag:

```html
<markdown include="vue/formatters.md"></markdown>
```

### Inline Markdown in Razor Pages

Alternatively markdown can be rendered inline with:

```html
<markdown>
## Using Formatters

Your App and custom templates can also utilize @servicestack/vue's
[built-in formatting functions](href="/vue/use-formatters).
</markdown>
```

### Light and Dark Mode Query Params

You can link to Dark and Light modes of your Razor SSG website with the `?light` and `?dark` query string params:

- [https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?dark](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?dark)
- [https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?light](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/?light)

### Blog Post Authors threads.net and Mastodon links

The social links for Blog Post Authors can now include [threads.net](https://threads.net) and [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) links, e.g:

```json
{
  "AppConfig": {
    "BlogImageUrl": "https://servicestack.net/img/logo.png",
    "Authors": [
      {
        "Name": "Lucy Bates",
        "Email": "lucy@email.org",
        "ProfileUrl": "img/authors/author1.svg",
        "TwitterUrl": "https://twitter.com/lucy",
        "ThreadsUrl": "https://threads.net/@lucy",
        "GitHubUrl": "https://github.com/lucy",
        "MastodonUrl": "https://mastodon.social/@lucy"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Feature Requests Welcome

Most of Razor SSG's features are currently being driven by requirements from the new 
[Websites built with Razor SSG](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/#showcase) and features we want available in our Blogs, 
we welcome any requests for missing features in other popular Blogging Platforms you'd like to see in Razor SSG to help 
make it a high quality blogging solution built with our preferred C#/.NET Technology Stack, by submitting them to:

:::div{.text-indigo-600 .text-3xl .text-center}
[https://servicestack.net/ideas](https://servicestack.net/ideas)
:::

### SSG or Dynamic Features

Whilst statically generated websites and blogs are generally limited to features that can be generated at build time, we're able to
add any dynamic features we need in [CreatorKit](https://servicestack.net/creatorkit/) - a Free companion self-host .NET App Mailchimp and Disqus 
alternative which powers any dynamic functionality in Razor SSG Apps like the blogs comments and Mailing List features 
in this Blog Post.
